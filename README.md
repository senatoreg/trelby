# Trelby
## Screenplay writing software
Trelby is a screenplay writing program. See http://www.trelby.org/ for
more details.

### About this project
This is a fork of the original codebase from https://github.com/trelby/trelby, which as of this writing appears to be dormant.

The major difference of this fork is conversion to Python 3.  I also have a list of possible enhancements in mind, and I'd love help updating the Windows packaging so that I can provide a Windows build.
