.\ext. stonehenge - night
>.A blizzard rages. Snow is everywhere and visibility is
>.almost zero. Only at brief moments do we catch sight of the
>.stones forming the monument. No one in his right mind would
..be out in this kind of weather.
._JASON
.:How long to the drop-off point?
._kevin
>:About one hour, if the wind stays
.:the same.
._JASON
>:I'll go entertain the others so
.:that they don't get suspicious.
./DISSOLVE TO:
.\ext. fishing boat - night
..SUPER: "THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - 04:00"
>.A calm night, with the ocean almost still. Two fishermen are
..smoking at the rear deck.
._fisherman #1
&:Aye,it'snightslikethisthatmakemerem
>:ember why I love being a fisherman.
>:Nothing but you, the boat, and the
>:sea. Don't get any better than
.:this.
._FISHERMAN #2
.((sadly)
>:I could use a bit more action,
.:myself.
>.Suddenly, huge blocks of stone rain down on the boat,
..smashing it to pieces.
.\INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
>.Jason, Kevin and Sarah are standing in front of the
|.emergency exit door, wearing parachutes, with a
|.bright
..yellow package at their feet.
.\EXT. OUTSIDE THE AIRPLANE - NIGHT
>.The yellow package drops from the airplane with 3 people
>.holding on to it. Within seconds of their exit the plane
..starts a steep dive.
>.The package and the people fall down. Just seconds before
>.hitting the ocean they release their grip on the package and
..open their parachutes.
..In the background, the plane crashes into the ocean.
.\Ext. Ocean - night
>.The package hits the water and is submerged. A few seconds
..later, a rapidly inflating liferaft appears.
>.The people land into the water in their parachutes. They
..dispose of them and swim toward the liferaft.
.\Int. Liferaft - night
>.They're all aboard, taking off their clothes. When they're
>.all naked, Sarah gathers the wet clothes, throws them out,
>.and closes the entrance to the tent-like liferaft. The men
>.openly admire Sarah's body, as she opens a storage locker
>.and takes out dry clothes for everyone which they then put
..on.
._KEVIN
.:I know a great way to warm up.
._SARAH
>:Sorry, I got over the "older men"
.:thing a while back.
._KEVIN
>:Anytime you have a flashback, let
.:me know.
.\EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
>.The liferaft bobs in the waves, utterly alone in the world.
>.Or maybe not so alone after all, for a small submarine
..surfaces just beside it.
.\Int. Submarine - night
>.Jason, Kevin and Sarah descend into the submarine. The
..captain is waiting for them.
._Captain
>:Welcome aboard. I trust everything
.:went well?
._jason
.:Splendid. How many men do you have?
._CAPTAIN
>:A skeleton crew of only five
>:handpicked men who I'd trust with
.:my life, just as you requested.
._jason
>:That's exactly what you're doing.
>:If word of this ever leaks out, we
>:both know I'm going to find you, no
>:matter how long it takes.
.:Understood?
._CAPTAIN
.:Of course.
._jason
.:Ok. Now let's get going.
.\Map of the atlantic ocean
>.A red line marks their progress southwest until it reaches
..Antigua.
.\EXT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT
>.Jason, Kevin and Sarah are ferried to a deserted beach by a
..silent rubber boat.
.\Map of the american continents
>.The red line snakes from Antigua to Dominican Republic, from
..there to Miami, and finally to Los Angeles.
.\ext. jason's house - day
..SUPER: "JASON'S HOUSE - LOS ANGELES"
..A luxurious mansion with a swimming pool in the backyard.
.\int. jason'S living room - DAY
>.Jason, Kevin and Sarah are sitting around sipping drinks and
>.watching the TV, which is showing a special report about the
..Stonehenge incident.
._Reporter
>:We still have no idea who did this.
>:The British government is
>:investigating several ransom
>:demands about the stones, but so
.:far they all appear to be fake.
>.The TV screen shows the monument site as it now is: A bunch
>.of holes in the ground, surrounded by yellow tape and police
..keeping people out.
._REPORTER
>:What possible motive could anyone
>:have to destroy one of the oldest
>:artifacts in the world? Police
.:claim to have no idea.
..Jason turns the TV off.
._JASON
.:That'll confuse them for a while.
._SARAH
.:So, what's next on the agenda?
._JASON
>:A strange letter was delivered to
>:here while we were away. It reads:
>:"Greetings. You may be wondering
>:how I knew how to contact you. When
>:I want something done, it gets
>:done, and when I wanted to know who
>:was the best thief in the world,
>:your name eventually surfaced. But
>:I digress. I have a job for you: I
>:want you to steal the rarest animal
>:in the world for me, the Russian
>:koala. It's a mutant offspring of
>:Australian koalas, developed by
>:Soviet scientists during the cold
>:war to eat the leaves off of all
>:trees, thus dooming all of North
>:America to starve to death as the
>:ecosystem collapses. There are only
>:five of these animals still alive,
>:and they're kept in a heavily
>:guarded secret Russian laboratory
>:near Vladivostok. I will contact
>:you again with further details in
.:the near future."
._SARAH
.:Does it say who sent it?
._JASON
>:The letter is signed by someone who
>:calls himself "ME USSR KOALA",
.:whatever that means.
._SARAH
.:Intriguing.
._JASON
.:Very.
